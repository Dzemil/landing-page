                    According to legend, 9th-century goat herders discovered how caffeine affected their goats,
                     who looked like they were "dancing" (probably high on caffeine) after eating the Coffea plant's fruit.

                    According to the International Coffee Organization, 
                    Brazil now produces about a third of the world's coffee supply, 
                    roughly twice as much as the runner-up, Vietnam.

                    The faeces (yes, you read that correctly) of an Asian palm civet is used to make 
                    one of the most sought-after types of coffee, called Kopi luwak - also known
